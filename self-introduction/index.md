Description:
Hello! How are you? My name’s Vadim and I’d like to tell you about myself.
I was born in Brest, Belarus. I really like this city. There are my mother, my sister and other people of family live in Brest. But some part of my relative live in Ukraine. And of course, I stand with Ukraine.
As for me.. I live in Warsaw, Poland with my wife and our beloved dog.
Warsaw drives me crazy. I love this city very well. I like the people, the dynamic of the city, and the feeling of freedom.
Generally, Poland is a beautiful country. Poland has mountains and sea. When I go on holiday to the mountains or the sea, I like to drive on the beautiful roads of Poland. I like traveling very well.
Ok) What about programming?
I try to learn JavaScript, but for me, it isn’t easy. I don’t know why. Maybe, I just want everything and now!) Perhaps.
Last time, I use ChatGPT for study. This technology helps me a lot. But I have to be very careful, because it also relaxes me, too.
I’d like to tell about English. My level of English is low. But I know that I need a lot of practice and I will have to middle level. It’s the same as in programming. I need more practice, like most of people.
Also, I learn Polish. We speak at home with my wife only Polish. Even when I speak to my dog, I use Polish language. But I think she doesn't understand me.
What about you? Write me please. I will be waiting;)
